# PyPrintPreview Development Notes

## Project Status: COMPLETE âœ“

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Developer**: aegno
**Assistant**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

## What Was Built

A complete PyQt5 GUI application for previewing and printing photos on 4x6" glossy paper with automatic orientation handling.

### Files Created
1. `pyprintpreview.py` (544 lines) - Main application
2. `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
3. `README.md` - Complete documentation

### Key Features Implemented
- âœ… GUI preview showing exactly how photo will print
- âœ… EXIF orientation support (auto-rotates based on metadata)
- âœ… Two scaling modes: Fill (crop) and Fit (borders)
- âœ… Automatic landscape/portrait detection
- âœ… 300 DPI high-resolution printing (1200x1800px)
- âœ… Configuration persistence (~/.config/pyprintpreview/settings.json)
- âœ… Printer selection with saved preferences
- âœ… 4x6" borderless printing setup
- âœ… Command-line and GUI usage
- âœ… Nemo file manager integration instructions

### Architecture

**Classes:**
- `Config`: Manages application settings (JSON persistence)
- `PhotoPreview`: QLabel widget handling image display and rendering
- `PhotoPrintWindow`: Main window with controls and UI

**Image Processing:**
- Uses PIL/Pillow for EXIF handling and image loading
- Uses QPixmap/QPainter for rendering and printing
- Separate preview and print rendering pipelines

**Print Settings:**
- Paper: 4x6" (101.6 x 152.4mm)
- Resolution: 300 DPI
- Orientation: Auto-detected from image dimensions
- Mode: Borderless (fullPage=True)

## Next Steps for Linux

### 1. Installation
```bash
cd ~/Documents/dev/PycharmProjects/PyPrintPreview
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# Or use system packages:
sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pil
```

### 2. Testing
```bash
chmod +x pyprintpreview.py
python3 pyprintpreview.py /path/to/test/image.jpg
```

### 3. Git Repository Setup
```bash
# Initialize repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: PyPrintPreview - 4x6 photo printing app

Complete PyQt5 application for previewing and printing photos on 4x6 glossy paper.
Features fill/fit modes, EXIF orientation support, and printer preference persistence.

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code"

# Optional: Add remote
# git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
# git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Nemo Integration (Optional)
Follow instructions in README.md section "Integration with Nemo File Browser"

## Testing Checklist

When testing in Linux:
- [ ] Application launches without errors
- [ ] Can load various image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- [ ] EXIF rotation works correctly
- [ ] Fill mode crops appropriately
- [ ] Fit mode adds borders correctly
- [ ] Landscape images rotate 90Â° for printing
- [ ] Portrait images remain upright
- [ ] Printer selection works
- [ ] Settings persist after closing
- [ ] Print dialog opens correctly
- [ ] Actual printing produces correct output

## Known Considerations

- **Windows vs Linux**: This was developed on Windows but designed for Linux Mint 22.2
- **Printer Drivers**: Canon inkjet printer support depends on system drivers
- **File Paths**: Uses Path from pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
- **Config Location**: ~/.config/pyprintpreview/ (Linux standard)

## If Issues Arise

Common fixes:
1. **Import errors**: Install system packages or use virtualenv
2. **No printers found**: Check CUPS service and printer setup
3. **Wrong orientation**: Verify EXIF data with `exiftool image.jpg`
4. **Print size wrong**: Check printer doesn't override with "fit to page"

## Chat Context

This project was completed in a single Claude Code session. The assistant:
1. Reviewed the existing code after VSCode window was accidentally closed
2. Confirmed all features were implemented
3. Verified documentation was complete
4. Provided this summary for cross-OS continuity
